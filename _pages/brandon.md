### Lab Values Statement
Each member of our lab brings something important to the team. We strive to create an environment where every lab member can achieve their full potential in the lab. Every voice should be heard. Diversity of thought and background are celebrated, and all are welcome. Respect for each other is integral to our lab culture.

This document is shared publicly on our website to remind lab members of the type of environment the CDAC seeks to foster.
