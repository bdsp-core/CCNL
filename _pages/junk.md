### Academics
> "Hold your peace, senor," said Sancho; "faith, if I take to asking questions and answering, I'll go on from this till to-morrow morning. Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn't go looking for help from my neighbors."  
"Thou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho," said Don Quixote; "for there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing to the understanding or memory."  
>  
> -- **_Miguel de Cervantes, The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. 1615_**

> There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance - that principle is contempt prior to investigation.  
>  
> **-- _Herbert Spencer, Apr 27 1820-1903._**

> Everyone engaged in research must have had the experience of working with feverish and prolonged intensity to write a paper which no one else will read or to solve a problem which no one else thinks important and which will bring no conceivable reward -- which may only confirm a general opinion that the researcher is wasting his time on irrelevancies.  
>  
> **-- _Noam Chomsky, A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior, Language, 35, No. 1 (1959), 26-58_**

> Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.
> Few things are harder to put up with than a good example.  
>  
> **-- _Mark Twain, 1835-1910_**

> For every problem, there is one solution which is simple, neat, and wrong.  
>  
> **-- _H. L. Mencken, 1880-1956_**  

> The academic politician is interested in victory. He has the moral code of Machiavelli, but, because he is too impatient to submit to the instruction of history, he has not the old master’s shrewd sense of human limitations and contradictions. He makes the worst of rulers: he is neither a lover of truth, nor a practical man of the world, nor an habitual examiner of his all-too-human and persistent failings.  
>  
> **-- _Anthony Ansolen, Higher Education in Hell (January 25, 2017)_**

> In my long experience I have learned what are the five most important characteristics of a good colleague, and I shall tell you them.
1.	He or she must tell you when you're wrong. When you've risen above the associate professor level most people are convinced that you think yourself infallible. Of course they're right, but it's annoying that they tell everybody else when you're wrong and won't tell you….
2.	The ideal colleague must tell you you're wrong without actually stopping you doing the experiment you're just planning. With some colleagues things stop dead when the idea is killed; With others the argument and discussion is such fun that the experiment gets forgotten….
3.	The ideal colleague must constantly convert a theoretical argument into an experimental prediction: ‘You say X is so, therefore Y should happen.’ This is the most basic step in all of science, but it's a rare ability to constantly make that step; most of us either waste our time basking in the brilliant sunshine of theory, or just love fiddling with the equipment. Come to think of it there's a third category: those who spend all their time writing grant applications.
4.	The ideal colleague must have read all the literature you cannot be bothered to read, must understand the historical development of the subject accurately and dispassionately, and whenever necessary must exaggerate the importance of your own role in it.
5.	Any colleague of any sort has to tidy up the lab after you've made a mess of it.

>. And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end; and much astudy is a weariness of the flesh.  
>   
> **--_Ecclesiastes 12:12_**
