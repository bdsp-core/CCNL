# Research

Our overarching goal is replace doctors with robots. To do so, we YYY.

Our goal is to XYZ.

Here are some projects we are currently working on:

**Automating Clinical Polysomnography Reporting.** XXX. blah blah


**Diagnosing Epilepsy.** XXX. blah blah.

**Measuring Delirium.** XXX. blah blah

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
blah blah.
