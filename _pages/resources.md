### Lab OKRs
Periodically (typically every 3-6 months) members of the lab draft "objectives and key results". The lab PI also writes a set of OKRs for the lab. You can read about OKRs [here](https://www.whatmatters.com/). The lab OKRs are accessible to lab members [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vgN_tTgaFeOmKnAcrsweqkeMgkukY79_1giEsRPn_w/edit?usp=sharing). Request access by emailing Brandon.
